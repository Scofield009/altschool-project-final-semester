After using Jenkins pipeline to deploy the prometheus and other necesarry files, AWS certification took a longer time to issue certificate. Also both the sock-shop and grafana couldn't be secured because of the certificate.
Also had to take a screenshot for it to show my domain name which is "afolabiibikunle.com.ng"
